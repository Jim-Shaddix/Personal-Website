# Personal Website
This is a personal website I built to show off some my projects. The website
uses Bootstrap for the frontend and Python's flask framework for the backend
with Jinja2 templating. This is a fairely simple website that has a naviagation bar with links 
to webpages for displaying my projects, some talks I have given, and a contact
page.
